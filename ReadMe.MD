#Shoper CSV Reader

This program reads a cvs file provided by Shoper platform. Then it downloads all jpg files listed in csv and writes them in proper folders.
Folder structure is created from article's names.

IMPORTANT:
My personal csv file had some slashes('/') in article's names. They were so few that I edited the file manually and replaced them with dashes('-').
Before that program was crushing while creating folders.
I will change article's names in Shoper's database.
